# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on the Titanic dataset. The main objective is to uncover patterns and relationships between passenger attributes (age, sex, class, etc.) and survival outcomes, which can later be used for predictive modeling.
