# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on the Titanic dataset. The main objective is to uncover patterns and relationships between passenger attributes (age, sex, class, etc.) and survival outcomes, which can later be used for predictive modeling.

## Dataset Used

## Key Questions (KPIs)
During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed:
What percentage of passengers survived overall?
How did gender and class (Pclass) impact survival chances?
Did age distribution play a role in survival rates?
What role did family size (SibSp + Parch) have on survival?
How did fare values vary across different survival outcomes?
